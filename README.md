# MaxiJonson's Website

## 4th edition

This is the public repository for my website, which is available to view [here](www.maxijonson.com). The website is written mainly in Typescript and uses React as front-end library. It is mostly my playground to experience with React's features, but it also my programming portfolio to showcase.

### Roadmap

You can check out [Trello](https://trello.com/b/9iho7pi4) to see the features that are planned, in progress, done and deployed to Heroku. The cards numbers (e.g.: MJ-26) refer to commits related to the task. If a commit doesn't have any number, it is probably because the commit was not particularly associated to a task.

### v4.4.0

As of v4.4.0, most of the website's core has moved to separate NPM package: [tchin-react-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tchin-react-components). This has been done so I can reuse core parts of my website if I ever make another React project, making it simple and fast to start a new project and spending less time on seting it up.
