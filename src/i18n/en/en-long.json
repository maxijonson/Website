I've been wanting to re-make it from scratch for a while, since I grew a lot it knowledge since then, but never found the time, until now! I'm very proud to have the opportunity to put my new skills to work! This website is mainly some kind of blog about me and my story, as well as a portfolio to showcase my programming works! If you're here from Youtube, where the name \"MaxiJonson\" was born, you guys were awesome followers! Unfortunately, I didn't have the time nor the motivation to make videos anymore, I hope you understand!"
